# HUB++ LTS ![Download counter](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/userbot8895/HBPlus-LTS/latest/total?color=%23aaaaa&label=downloads)
Long-term support version of [HUB++](https://github.com/userbot8895/HUB-Plus).

Each time HUB++ is updated to support a new major version of HyperUBot, the last version of ++ supported by the previous userbot version is released here. The previous LTS version is pushed to the [`old` branch](https://github.com/userbot8895/HBPlus-LTS/tree/old).

## Installation
### `main` branch
The installation procedure is the same as the one for the [stable version](https://github.com/userbot8895/HyperBot-Plus/blob/master/guides/Install.md), but instead of adding `userbot8895/HyperBot-Plus` as a repo add `userbot8895/HBPlus-LTS`.
### `old` branch
1. Download the repo.
2. Copy the contents of the `src` folder to the userbot's `modules_user` folder.
3. Remove the modules you don't need.
