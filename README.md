# HyperBot++ LTS
Long-term support version of [HyperBot++](https://github.com/userbot8895/HyperBot-Plus).

## Installation
The installation procedure is the same as the one for the [stable version](https://github.com/userbot8895/HyperBot-Plus/blob/master/guides/Install.md), with these differences:

- HyperBot++ LTS doesn't (yet) have HyperBot++ Setup.
- Instead of adding `userbot8895/HyperBot-Plus` as a repo add `userbot8895/HBPlus-LTS`.
